# ESP32_Indicator_BLE
This project implements an ESP32-based vehicle indicator system controllable via push buttons and BLE from a mobile phone. Simulink-generated logic handles LEFT, RIGHT, HAZARD, and OFF states. BLE commands override manual inputs in real time. The system ensures smooth control and reliable operation using a 100ms loop.
